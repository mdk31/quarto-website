description: 'May 2022 ACIC poster presentation'

---

We are well-past the 2022 ACIC conference but, since I'm starting a new website and don't have anything to post, I'd figure I'd show what I'm currently working on. This is the [poster](acic_poster.pdf) I presented at the conference in May. It's still a work in progress and I'm currently working with Michele Santacatterina and Lin Wang on finalizing the paper.
