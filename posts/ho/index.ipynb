        "Hyperparameter optimization is a critical aspect of machine learning, where the objective is to discover the ideal configuration settings, or \"hyperparameters\", for a given model. While standard parameters are adjusted during the training process based on data, hyperparameters, such as learning rates or regularization terms, are set prior to this phase. These can include the weight decay parameter, the number of hidden layers, etc. The goal is to find hyperparameters that result in the best model performance, often measured by validation accuracy or loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "The standard technique for hyperparamter optimization (HO) is grid search, where every possible combination of hyperparameters is tested. Because of the vast potential combinations of hyperparameters, you random search is often employed where RANDOM. The problem with either of these techniques is that they require you to train multiple models that will later be discarded [@mlodozeniec2023hyperparameter, p. 1]. Moreover, these methods are not scalable to cases with many hyperparameters [@lorraine2020optimizing] [@maclaurin2015gradient]\n",
        "\n",
        "It would be preferable if we could update hyperparameters in the same way we update model parameters, i.e., through the use of gradient-based methods. Similar to updates to parameters, and differently from grid search methods, we hope that we can make use of previous evaluation to \"make an informed decision of the next iterate\" [@pedregosa2016hyperparameter]. In this post, I will illustrate the application of gradient-based HO methods to a simple neural network to optimize the weight decay hyperparameter. I thought this would be a good test case to get more familiar with PyTorch.\n",

        "# Gradient Computation\n",
        "\n",
        "The first hurdle to overcome in gradient HO is the fact that you cannot optimize hyperparameter to minimize the same loss function as the parameters; in the example of weight decay, this would always lead to preferring models with no penalization [@pedregosa2016hyperparameter]. As a result, we need to use cross-validation or a holdout validation set to optimize a criterion on unseen data. We use a validation set and construct HO as a two-level optimization problem as in @pedregosa2016hyperparameter and @lorraine2020optimizing. Let $\\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\\mathcal{L}_V$ be the training and validation loss, respectively. Both of these depend on the hyperparamters $\\boldsymbol\\lambda$ and model parameters $\\mathbf{w}$, whether directly or indircetly (more on this later). First, we train the model and update the model parameters for a given value of $\\boldsymbol\\lambda$. Then we update the hyperparameters:\n",
