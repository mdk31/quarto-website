        "Hyperparameter optimization is a critical aspect of machine learning. When optimizing hyperparameters, our objective is to discover the ideal configuration of hyperparameters for a given model. While standard parameters are adjusted during the training process based on data, hyperparameters, such as learning rates or regularization terms, are set prior to the learning phase.\n",
        "\n",
        "The standard technique for hyperparameter optimization (HO) is grid search where every possible combination of hyperparameters is tested. Because of the vast potential combinations of hyperparameters, random search, where a random subset of hyperparameters is used, is often attempted. The problem with either of these techniques is that they require you to train multiple models that will later be discarded [@mlodozeniec2023hyperparameter, p. 1]. Moreover, neither of these methods are scalable to cases with many hyperparameters [@lorraine2020optimizing; @maclaurin2015gradient]\n",
        "\n",
        "It would be preferable if we could update hyperparameters in the same way we update model parameters, i.e., through the use of gradient-based methods. Ideally, we would calculate the derivative of the loss function with respect to each hyperparameter and then update the hyperparameters, i.e.:\n",

        "Luckily, there have been a variety of papers published proposing gradient-based methods to update hyperparameters. In this post, I will apply the gradient-based HO outline from @lorraine2020optimizing to a simple neural network with a single weight decay hyperparameter. I thought this would be a good test case to get more familiar with PyTorch, which makes much of the computation extremely easy and efficient.\n",

        "\n",
        "The first hurdle to overcome in gradient-based HO is the fact that you cannot optimize hyperparameters with respect to the same loss function you use for the parameters. For example, optimizing the training loss with respect to the weight decay penalty would always lead to preferring models with no penalization [@pedregosa2016hyperparameter]. Instead, we use a validation set and consider HO as a two-level optimization problem, as in @pedregosa2016hyperparameter and @lorraine2020optimizing.\n",

Both of these depend on the hyperparameters $\\boldsymbol\\lambda$ and model parameters $\\mathbf{w}$, whether directly or indirectly (more on this later).
